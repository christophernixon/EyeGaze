### To add PDFs to PDF library: 

Add PDF to SheetMusic folder. Ensure PDF is named with lowercase letters only, with '.pdf' extension at the end. Add PDF title to `testData` in `PDF.swift` file, without '.pdf' extension.


### SeeSo:

The use of SeeSo SDK requires an API license key, which can be obtained from [https://seeso.io/](https://seeso.io/). Replace all occurances of 'INSERT_SEESO_LICENSE_HERE' in project with license key. SeeSo also requires an active internet connection to validate the license, so the app must have internet conectivity while running.

### Xcode Simulator

The app must be run on a real device rather than the Xcode Simulator as the front-facing camera is used.
